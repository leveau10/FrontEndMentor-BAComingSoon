This project is a Frontend Mentor Challenge. I used HTML, CSS and JS without libs or frameworks. Inside the repository you can find the prototype designed with Figma.

I leanerd how to use SVGs and change the display property of elements depending on the screensize.

In the deploy you also can find a link to the challenge's page: https://base-apparel-coming-soon-master-iota-two.vercel.app/
